                <p>Short for malicious software, it refers to any intrusive software or code developed by cybercriminals<br>which are designed to damage, interfere or gain unauthorised access to computer systems, networks, or devices.<br>It can also involve removing or stealing data from a computer or network.</p>

            <h2>Viruses</h2>
            <p>A type of malware which is attached to a document or file that supports macros to execute its code and spread from host to host. Once downloaded, it will lie dormant until the file is opened and in use. Viruses are designed with different objectives, some are made to deliberately damage files, others may just spread to other computers without causing any immediate harm. The capabilities of a virus depends on its programming and purpose which can vary widely. But generally. viruses cause significant operational issues and data loss. (Cisco, n.d)

            <p>Worms are a type of malware which are designed to spread without requiring human interaction. They propagate from one computer to another through various ways one of which includes exploiting vulnerabilities in network services of softwares. Worms can allow attackers to gain access to victim's computers remotely.</p>

            <p>A trojan horse is a computer program that hides a virus or another harmful program. It is often a program which tells the victim that they complete one action when in reality, it is performing a malicious attack on their computer. They are often used by attackers to steal sensitive information from the victim.</p>

                    <li>The Chernobyl virus emerged in 1999, it infected Windows based operating systems (Rosario, 2023)</li>
                    <li>The virus was initially designed to overwrite PE format files, when first installed, the virus would split and insert itself into empty spaces of a file. (Byju's, n.d) This allows the virus to invade programs without damaging or increasing its size, additionally this enables the virus to remain undetected for long periods of time. (Enzor, 2023)</li>
                    <li>The virus primarily affected those in Asian and Middle Eastern countries due to the prevalence of pirated operating systems as well as discounted computer security. (Rosario, 2023)</li>
                    <p><br><b>Effects</b></p>
                    <li><b>Security risk: </b>Although it was not destructive by nature, it made the system vulnerable to other malware</li>
                    <li><b>Compromised system: </b>Although it did not cause immediate damage to the computer files, the presence of the virus itself can affect a system's performance. Infected files would have experienced slowdowns or instability.</li>
                    <li><b>Financial impact: </b>It was estimated that the virus caused $250 million USD in damages and data recovery (Latona, 2000)</li><br><br><br>

                    <li>The virus was primarily spread through email attachments. These emails contained an attachment in it claiming that it was a love letter to the victim.</li>
                    <li>When a user opened the attachment, it would execute a Visual basic script (VBS) program. The program would then overwrite the victim's personal files (thus destroying them) and spread itself by emailing all the contacts in the victim's address book. (Awati, 2021)</li>

The primary goal of the original Zeus virus was to steal financial information from its victims, unlike other malware, its goal was not to cause damage to the infected system because otherwise antivirus softwares would be able to identify it.</li>
                        <li>The first Zeus virus was detected in 2007</li>
                        <li>It became one of the most successful botnet softwares which led to other variants of the Trojan to emerge later on.</li>

                        <li><b>Financial impact: </b>Estimated to have caused $100 million USD in financial damages. (Crowdstrike, 2023)</li>
                        <li><b>Damage: </b>The Zeus virus is still a relevant threat, new Trojans are still active in the present day despite the original code being retired. This is due to the code becoming open sourced in 2011 thus leading to new and more dangerous variations to arise.</li>
